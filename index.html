                            Hi, My name is Hyangsu and I am a junior game programmer.<br>
                            I have a background as a mechanical engineer which gives me great insight and understanding into
                             the way things work and how to learn from mistakes.
                            I am very persistent and don't get easily frustrated.
                            In one project, I was able to solve a tricky collision detection issue by rewriting the collision system in place.
                            In addition to this, I am very well organized.
                            I plan and prioritize work efficiently to ensure that deadlines are met,
                             giving sufficient time for unexpected errors or sudden requests outside of the current scope.
                            Using proper design and planning documents I schedule my tasks so that I always finish on time and on schedule.
                            Based on my strengths, I believe I can start my game programming career successfully on graduation.
