                            Hi, I am a junior game programmer with two strengths.<br>
The first is persistence. In my experience as a mechanical engineer, I have completed projects after a series of failures. With this strength, I was able to solve a collision detection issue in the game programming task by replacing it with a completely different code.
<br><br>The second is planning. I have a habit of prioritizing and planning to complete projects on time even if there are unexpected problems or customer requests outside of my project. Even when programming, I make a basic framework through the game design document and make a schedule so that I always finish on time and on schedule.
Based on my strengths, I believe I can start my game programming career successfully on graduation.
