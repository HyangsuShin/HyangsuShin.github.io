                             I am a junior game developer with 5 years of
experience in mechanical engineering. My interests in
math and physics brought me into the world of game
programming, and I want to start a new career as a
game developer.<br><br>
Throughout my Game Programming courses, I have
demonstrated my superior skills in C++ by creating
games in programming fundamentals, SDL, OpenGL,
and networking classes.
 I excelled in my programming assignments achieving many perfect scores.
 I enjoy fixing bugs and learning how to optimize and improve efficiency of code.
 In addition, I have learned how to
use Phaser and Unity to make games. To edit designs, I
used Gimp and Blender. In my <a href="portfolio.html" style="font-weight: bold;">portfolio</a>, I list details
about each class's project.<br><br>
Having worked on a variety of team projects, I am well accustomed to working
collaboratively. Throughout my career as a mechanical engineer, I worked with a variety of
teams to build car paint factories. I demonstrated collaborative skills as I always encouraged
active communication and offered detailed feedback to ensure that I kept my teams united
and working towards our common goal. I shared scheduling and notifications with other
teams right away to ensure development was completed on time, and the schedule sheet I
created then became the company's standard template.<br><br>
I have had the opportunity to travel extensively throughout my life, and these experiences
have enhanced my creativity as a developer by exploring new perspectives.<br><br>
I am ready to take the leap and continue to hone my skills with the right company. By
contributing to the development of an innovative game world in the future, I intend to offer
solutions to problems and create a more complete play.
